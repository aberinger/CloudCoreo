Redshift connections don't require SSL
 Description "Connections to Redshift aren't set to require the use of SSL encryption."
 Suggested_action_brief
 "Enable Redshift to require the use of SSL encrypted connections."

Details
Amazon Redshift supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections to encrypt data and server certificates to validate the server certificate that the client connects to. By default, cluster databases accept a connection whether it uses SSL or not. Currently, connections to the affected Redshift cluster aren't set to require the use of SSL encryption.

Suggested Action
 "Enable Redshift to require the use of SSL encrypted connections. To configure your cluster to require an SSL connection, set the require_SSL parameter to true in the parameter group that is associated with the cluster. To support SSL connections, Amazon Redshift creates and installs a self-signed SSL certificate on each cluster. SSL support in Amazon Redshift is strictly for encrypting the connection between your client and your cluster; it should not be relied on for authenticating the server."
