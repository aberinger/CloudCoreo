Details
Logging provides a way to get detailed access logs delivered to a bucket you choose. An access log record contains details about the request, such as the request type, the resources specified in the request worked, and the time and date the request was processed.  Server access logs are useful for many applications because they give bucket owners insight into the nature of requests made by clients not under their control. By default, Amazon S3 doesn't collect service access logs, but when you enable logging Amazon S3 delivers access logs to your bucket on an hourly basis.
