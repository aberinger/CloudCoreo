For example, a public WRITE_ACP permission on your bucket enables anyone to modify the ACL and grant permissions such as, for example, grant write permission on your bucket to others.

Additional info
"Amazon S3 provides a rich set of mechanisms for you to manage access to your buckets and objects. An Access Control List (ACL) is one of these access control mechanisms. ACLs identify which AWS account or groups are allowed to perform what kind of actions. To learn more about the groups and types of permissions, read the Access Control List (ACL) Overview.
