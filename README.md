# CloudCoreo Knowledgebase 1st Draft

In phase 1 of the knowledge base, I have added applicable text and blurbs from other sources and attributed where appropriate. This will enable us to get some useful text available right away.

Probably want to reflect the applicable service in these articles. I left the original code in that reflects the service. We will want to consider how this is all laid out. Category and Level might be best to leave on the original alert.
